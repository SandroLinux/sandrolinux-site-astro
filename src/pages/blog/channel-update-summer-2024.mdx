Hello everyone. 

It has been a while since I last posted on this blog, and I wanted to give everyone an update on what is to come in the future of my channel.

Recently, I built a new PC running Arch Linux. However, it has had issues with sound so it may be a while until my videos are made using it.

However, my switch to Linux does mean that in the future I will be making more videos covering Linux software and news (I know, finally my channel name may reflect my content).

Secondly, I am currently looking for a Peertube instance to upload my videos to, so that may be a new option for viewing my content in the future. When (and if) I do make a Peertube channel, I will write a blog post on here to announce it.

Finally, in addition to [adding set segments](../segments) to Sandro's Saturday Sum Up, I have also started publishing [the sources](../sources) for each video.

I hope you enjoy my content going into the future, and thank you for reading this update.
