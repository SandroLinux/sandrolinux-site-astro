So the original reason behind me purchasing the domain name sandrolinux.net was to be a non-javascript dependent verision of my website.

I had to make this seperate version because the old Next JS verision of sandrolinux.com didn't work in text-based browsers such as <a href="https://invisible-island.net/lynx/">Lynx</a>. 

However, with the Astro redesign of my website, it can now load in text-based browsers and without javascript which removes the need for sandrolinux.net.

So to address this, I have removed the main sandrolinux.net website and instead setup a redirect to sandrolinux.com. 

Despite that, sandrolinux.net will sometimes be used for testing.
